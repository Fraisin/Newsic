</h1>

MusicDex is a web application designed to provide users with an endless stream of new music based on their own tastes. Through a set of endpoints provided by [Spotify's Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), users can add a combination of artists, tracks and genres to their mixture to generate a playlist of tracks that they'd find enjoyable. 

Built with Angular 8 and Bootstrap, MusicDex is designed to be modernized, beautiful, and quick.
